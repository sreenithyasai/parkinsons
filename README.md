# Parkinson's Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains various features that are relevant to the prediction model.

## Project Structure

- **data/parkinsons.csv**: This file contains the dataset used for predicting Parkinson's disease. It includes various features relevant to the prediction model.
  
- **notebooks/parkinsons-prediction.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for data analysis and model training for predicting Parkinson's disease. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python dependencies required for the project, ensuring that the necessary libraries are installed for the notebook to run successfully.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Open the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` directory.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Modify the input data as needed to test different scenarios for prediction.
